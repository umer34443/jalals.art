This repository contains a simple Python module that illustrates how a snake grows fatter when it eats an apple and cycles through new colors each time it eats.

## Running the simulation

Run the script directly to watch the snake eat apples and change color:

```bash
python snake.py
```

Customize the simulation with command line flags:

```bash
python snake.py --apples 4 --length-gain 2 --girth-gain 3
```

The output describes the snake after each apple, including its new color.
